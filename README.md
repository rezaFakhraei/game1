# Roll Dice Game



## About the Game
Welcome to the Roll Dice Game, created by rezaFakhraei! This JavaScript-based game is a simple and entertaining way to test your luck and strategy.

### Game Rules
- The game starts with Player 1.
- Players take turns rolling a dice.
- If a player rolls a number other than 1, that number is added to their current score.
- Players can choose to "Hold" their current score, which adds it to their total score and ends their turn.
- Rolling a 1 will reset the current score to zero, and it becomes the next player's turn.
- The first player to reach a specified target score(100score) wins the game.

Enjoy the game and may the best roller win!
